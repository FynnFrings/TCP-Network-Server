Add the [ReadOnly] attribute before a variable to have it show in the inspector but be uneditable.





Note: The variable needs to show in the inspector before adding the attribute. 
Therefore, the variable should be public or also have the [SerializeField] attribute. 
The [ReadOnly] attribute will only work on serializable variables.
